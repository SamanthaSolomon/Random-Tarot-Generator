## Build Status
 - MVP complete
 - Post MVP plans include:
     - Adding minor arcana so deck is complete
     - Including random inversion of the cards, which changes the mean of the card
     - Clear button to clear the board and start again

## Code, Style & Framework
 - HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS
