## The Task 

![](https://i.imgur.com/XBC5rpN.png)

- Using jQuery, make a div with the text "Add random image". Add a class to make the div square (100 x 100). Give it some color.
- The div should have cursor: pointer in its CSS, so that when the user hovers the cursor over the div, the cursor turns into a pointer thing.
- Given this array: 
```js 
const cards = [
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-fool.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-magician.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-high-priestess.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-empress.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-emperor.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-heirophant.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-chariot.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/strength.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-hermit.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/wheel-of-fortune.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/justice.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-hanged-man.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/death.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/temperance.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-tower.png',
  'https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-moon.png'
]
```

- Make it so that when you click the "Add random image" div, one random image from your array will appear on the page.
- Make it so an image is added rather than replaced.
- Make it so the images are added horizontally.
- Each added image can run the same function to achieve this goal.

## Hungry for More? 
- Add an input element that takes a new URL that allows you to add a new URL string to your array
- Use the URL to make a human readable alt attribute. ex: `https://www.trustedtarot.com/img/cards/the-fool.png` to be `The Fool`
- Make it so that when you click on one of the added images, it will be removed from the page.
